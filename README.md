# Metro-Induction-Project

Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Software Category

📘 Project Overview
Modern metro operations face increasing complexity in scheduling, maintenance, and resource utilization. Train induction — the process of deciding which train should enter service, when, and from which depot — is traditionally performed manually by supervisors. This process is often time-consuming, error-prone, and unable to adapt quickly to real-time changes such as maintenance delays, resource shortages, or dynamic passenger demand.

Our project, AI-Driven Train Induction Planning and Scheduling System for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), tackles this challenge by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), Operations Research (OR), and data analytics into a unified, intelligent platform.

The solution provides:
	•	Automated train induction planning that aligns with KMRL’s maintenance, safety, and operational policies.
	•	Predictive insights that anticipate potential scheduling conflicts and maintenance requirements.
	•	Optimization algorithms that ensure balanced fleet usage, minimizing idle time and maximizing efficiency.
	•	Interactive dashboards for supervisors to visualize train readiness, fleet health, and performance trends.

By combining rule-based filtering, machine learning models, and optimization techniques, the system not only enhances operational reliability but also lays the groundwork for KMRL’s transition into a smart, data-driven metro ecosystem.
It transforms static planning into a dynamic, adaptive, and continuously improving process that evolves with feedback and real-time data.

💡 Key Features<br>
	•	🔍 Rule-Based Filtering: Validates incoming data to ensure only reliable inputs are processed.<br>
	•	🤖 AI Predictions: Uses machine learning (Random Forest) to predict maintenance and scheduling needs.<br>
	•	📊 Interactive Dashboard: Displays KPIs, alerts, and performance trends through a responsive web interface.<br>
	•	⚙️ Optimization Engine: Ranks induction plans using OR-based optimization for balanced mileage and resource usage.<br>
	•	🔁 Continuous Learning: ML feedback loop for improving accuracy over time.<br>
	•	🧠 What-If Simulations: Simulate multiple scenarios to test alternative plans before implementation.<br>
	•	🧩 Manual Override & Audit Trail: Supervisors can override AI recommendations while maintaining transparency.
